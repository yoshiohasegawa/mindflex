# Mindflex

## Description
> This is a project folder for an iOS game application. Specifically, this application is a simple and fun reflex quiz game that challenges your mind.

## Supporting Server
This game is supported by a backend server ([mindflex-server](https://github.com/yoshiohasegawa/mindflex-server)) hosted on a cloud machine that provides endpoints and routes for question data. When the application starts an API request is made during the loading page which responds with question data that supports gameplay. Once the request has been fulfilled the application continues to the home page. From here, the user can tap "Begin" to continue to the game.
